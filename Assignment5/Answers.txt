    From ./Fun run:
        $ dotnet fsi -r ./FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll Absyn.fs FunPar.fs FunLex.fs Parse.fs HigherFun.fs ParseAndRunHigher.fs
    And in fsi write:
        open ParseAndRunHigher;;
        run <| fromString "let add x = let f y = x+y in f end in add 2 5 end";;
        run <| fromString "let add x = let f y = x+y in f end in let addtwo = add 2 in addtwo 5 end end";;
        run <| fromString "let add x = let f y = x+y in f end in let addtwo = add 2 in let x = 77 in addtwo 5 end end end";;
        run <| fromString "let add x = let f y = x+y in f end in add 2 end";;
    
    In the third function the inner x is assigned 77, but that is never used in the calculation, because x is never used in the body of that statement.
    In the last function, the result is a closure, because the add function returns another function, which expect an input. But since this is never given a closure of adds environment is returned.
