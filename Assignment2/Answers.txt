    exc 2.1
            (remove "gm" if it should not be there. "g" is for "global", not returning after first match
            and "m" is for multi-line, making it possible to have multiple lines as single input)
        a: /.*(?:42).*/gm     
        b: /^(?!.*42).*/gm
        c: /^(?!.*42).*/gm              (Taking into account that number-strings should not be multi-liners)
